        <h1>Data Structures</h1>
        <p class="horizontal-margin" style="line-height: 1.5">There are countless data structures that are all important for programmers to learn,so I thought it might be helpful to have some visualizations for different data structures to make it easier to visualize many of them. I don't have many so far, but I plan to keep adding more, both because I think it will be helpful to have visualizations of more data structures, and also that it's kinda fun to make them. Also, there isn't really a specific correct way to illustrate the data structures, so this is just how I thought would illustrate them best. Here are the different visualizations I have made so far:</p>
