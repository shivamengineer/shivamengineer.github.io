        <h1 class="wp-block-heading">Data Structures</h1>
        <p class="horizontal-margin" style="line-height: 1.5">There are countless data structures that are all important for programmers to learn,so I thought it might be helpful to have some visualizations for different data structures to make it easier to visualize many of them. I don't have many so far, but I plan to keep adding more, both because I think it will be helpful to have visualizations of more data structures, and also that it's kinda fun to make them. Also, there isn't really a specific correct way to illustrate the data structures, so this is just how I thought would illustrate them best. Here are the different visualizations I have made so far:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#binary-search-tree">Binary Search Tree</a></li>
            <li><a href="#stack">Stack</a></li>
            <li><a href="#queue">Queue</a></li>
        </ul>
        <a href="BinarySearchTree/bst.html">
            <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="binary-search-tree">Binary Search Tree</h2>
        </a>
        <p class="horizontal-margin" style="line-height: 1.5">This was the first tool that I made, and I started making it when I was researching the Rotation. Distance problem. But it took me longer than expected to make this and the main goal of this was to visualize and programatically do rotations of nodes in a binary search tree. I haven't seen many tools for tree rotations, and I thought it could be cool to have all the operations animated, so I just kept working on it and got it to the point where it is currently. I think eventually, I might work on other types of binary search trees, such as AVL trees or Red Black trees as I think those are used more often due to the self balancing nature of them.</p>
        <a href="BasicDataStructures/Stack/stack.html">
            <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="stack">Stack</h2>
        </a>
        <p class="horizontal-margin" style="line-height: 1.5">I wanted to add some visualizations for some more basic data structures as well, and a stack was probably the simplest. I think that popping elements from the stack could be changed to some way that better illustrates how that information is used, so that's one of the things I plan to work on soon. I think that it'll be helpful to better illustrate how a stack can be used, so maybe having a string of the popped values could be a useful feature to add in the near future.</p>
        <a href="BasicDataStructures/Queue/queue.html">
            <h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="queue">Queue</h2>
        </a>
        <p class="horizontal-margin" style="line-height: 1.5">Queues are pretty similar in complexity to stacks, though they generally have different applications. I think for both queues and stacks, it's the most simple to think of real life examples, but I thought that a visualization for both of these would still be useful, as it's a bit confusing when it's just numbers. I'll need to change this and the stack to allow the user to input more than just positive numbers, but I thought that it would be simple just to allow that. But adding strings might make it more obvious how they can be used for queues as well. I also think it will be useful for the queue as well to add some visual for what elements have been enqueued or dequeued from the queue so the use cases become more obvious.</p>
